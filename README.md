 During my internship at DirectFn, I designed and developed a complete Point of Sale (POS) system using .NET 
(C#), Windows Forms, DevExpress, and ADO.NET. The system facilitates seamless sales transactions, product 
management, and billing processes. I integrated Crystal Reports and DevExpress Reporting to generate detailed 
invoices and sales reports. The application supports real-time calculations, and multiple payment methods, 
ensuring smooth and efficient transactions. Additionally, I optimized database interactions using SQL and stored 
procedures, enhancing performance and reliability. This project strengthened my skills in debugging, UI/UX 
design, and feature enhancements, contributing to a scalable and user-friendly retail solution.
